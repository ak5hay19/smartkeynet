## Next task

Build `experiments/train.py`: a real overfit-S1-on-purpose training
campaign for `agents/dqn.py`'s `DQNAgent` (PLAN.md §10 step 5), with
checkpointing (`DQNAgent.save`/`load` already exist) and a training curve
— then evaluate the trained agent through `experiments/harness.py`
against the tuned `StaticThresholdPolicy` baseline on S1 and S3 to
attempt Gate W3. (S3 scenario dispatch isn't wired into `environment.py`
yet either — check that first; it may need to happen in the same
session or immediately before it.)

## Milestone checklist

Pulled from PLAN.md §10 (kickoff order) and §7 / split.md §2 (weekly gates).

- [x] Repo scaffolded (folder skeleton, `env/contracts.py` frozen, CI + PR template)
- [x] Gate W1 — `pytest` green on stubs; contracts frozen and committed
- [x] Spine wired end-to-end into `environment.py` — pool sim + deferral queue
      + masking + forecaster (EWMA) + request stream (random) + full reward
      formula, `reset()`/`step()` running a complete S1 episode with regret
      logging
- [x] Gate W2 — env `step()` runs end-to-end with a random valid agent across
      a full S1 episode; regret events logged
- [ ] Real NetworkX tenant graph + graph-driven `RequestGenerator`
      (`build_tenant_graph`, `RequestGenerator.reset/step`) — PLAN.md §10 step 4
- [x] Masked DQN agent (`agents/dqn.py`)
- [x] Four tuned baselines — always-PQC, always-hybrid, static-threshold
      (grid-searched), random (`agents/baselines.py`) + comparison harness
      (`experiments/harness.py`) — Hard Rule 7
- [ ] 🚩 Gate W3 (make-or-break) — DQN beats the tuned threshold baseline on S1 and S3
- [ ] Soft-reward baseline agent reproducing Noetzold (`agents/soft_reward_baseline.py`)
- [ ] Scenario dispatch S2-S4 wired into `environment.py` (`config["scenario"]`
      is currently read but not acted on)
- [ ] Real LSTM dual-head forecaster (Addition A) — `forecaster/model.py`,
      `forecaster/dataset.py`, `forecaster/train.py`, `LSTMForecastProvider`
      in `env/forecast_provider.py`
- [ ] E-A foresight ablation (off / ewma / lstm on S3 + S6)
- [ ] Steering attack — adversarial threat-trace generator (`attack/steering_trace.py`)
      + attack run producing the split-screen result — Gate W5, headline contribution, never cut
- [ ] S6 migration wave (scripted schedule, held-out eval only)
- [ ] Live dashboard (`dashboard/app.py`) — 4-beat demo
- [ ] AWS-KMS-style API facade (`api/main.py`)
- [ ] Report (`docs/report.md`) — currently a section-header skeleton with TODOs only

## Per-file status

Status values: **not started** (stub, `raise NotImplementedError`, 11-line
import-smoke test only) · **stub (partial)** (some functions real, some
still `NotImplementedError`) · **implemented+tested** (real logic, real
behavioral tests, part of the green `pytest` run).

### env/

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `env/contracts.py` | implemented+tested | Frozen interface contract — `Action`, `StateDict`, `ForecastProvider` ABC, `Request`, event-log TypedDicts. 5 real tests (`test_contracts.py`). |
| `env/pool_sim.py` | implemented+tested | `PoolSim` (refill/drain/exhaustion) + `SyntheticSKRQBERTrace`. 19 tests (`test_pool_sim.py`). |
| `env/deferral_queue.py` | implemented+tested | `DeferralQueue.enqueue/tick/pop_servable`, priority+FIFO, cumulative-headroom draw. 8 tests (`test_deferral_queue.py`). |
| `env/masking.py` | implemented+tested | `PolicyTable` (placeholder floor table, sticky ratchet) + `compute_mask`. 14 tests (`test_masking.py`). Floor table not yet calibrated against Q-OPSEC data. |
| `env/forecast_provider.py` | stub (partial) | `MovingAverageForecaster` (EWMA fallback) implemented+tested (9 tests, `test_forecast_provider.py`). `LSTMForecastProvider` does not exist yet (Addition A) — `use_foresight: lstm` currently raises `NotImplementedError` in `environment.py`. |
| `env/request_generator.py` | stub (partial) | `random_request_generator()` implemented+tested (8 tests, `test_request_generator.py`). `build_tenant_graph()` and `RequestGenerator` (graph-driven stream) still `raise NotImplementedError`. |
| `env/environment.py` | implemented+tested | `SmartKeyNetEnv.reset/step/action_mask` fully wired (pool + deferral + masking + forecast + reward + session-key state). 14 behavioral tests incl. the split.md Gate W2 tests (`test_environment.py`). Only S1 scenario dispatch exists; S2-S6 config is read but not acted on. |

### agents/

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `agents/dqn.py` | implemented+tested | `flatten_state(state, has_forecast)` (genuinely variable-length: 13 dims under `off`, 28 under `ewma`/`lstm`; `has_forecast` is now an **explicit required parameter** — the earlier `state["threat_score"] != 0.0` inference trick was removed 2026-08-08 as fragile-by-accident, see that session's log entry). `QNetwork` (2-hidden-layer MLP), `DQNConfig`/`load_dqn_config` (reads `configs/default.yaml`'s `dqn:` block), `DQNAgent(state_dim, has_forecast, config)` (internal circular-buffer replay, `act`/`observe`/`learn`/`save`/`load`, `has_forecast` fixed once at construction and threaded through every internal `flatten_state` call) — masking applied structurally at both action-selection *and* bootstrap-target time (Hard Rule 2), no security term anywhere (Hard Rule 1). 23 tests (`test_dqn.py`), incl. a regression test for a foresight-mode state with `threat_score == 0.0` still flattening to 28 dims, and an integration test training against the real `SmartKeyNetEnv` on S1 for 3000 steps with loss trending down. Not yet run to convergence — that's `experiments/train.py`. |
| `agents/baselines.py` | implemented+tested | `AlwaysPQCPolicy`, `AlwaysHybridPolicy`, `StaticThresholdPolicy` (incl. `grid_search`), `RandomPolicy` — all real, sharing a `_lowest_legal_action` fallback. 261 tests (`test_baselines.py`), incl. an adversarial parametrized sweep over all 31 non-empty action masks per policy (never returns an illegal action, however contrived the mask). |
| `agents/soft_reward_baseline.py` | not started | Stub, `test_soft_reward_baseline.py` is 1 import-smoke test. |

### forecaster/

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `forecaster/model.py` | not started | Stub, `test_forecaster_model.py` is 1 import-smoke test. |
| `forecaster/dataset.py` | not started | Stub, `test_forecaster_dataset.py` is 1 import-smoke test. |
| `forecaster/train.py` | not started | Stub, `test_forecaster_train.py` is 1 import-smoke test. |

### metrics/

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `metrics/regret.py` | implemented+tested | `compute_episode_metrics()` + `attribute_regret()`. 11 tests (`test_regret.py`). |

### experiments/

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `experiments/harness.py` | implemented+tested | `run_scenario` (one policy x scenario x seed episode → `ScenarioResult`, truncated via `max_steps`, default 250) + `run_grid` (every combination). Recomputes per-decision latency/hybrid-draw resolution from public `StateDict` fields (mirrors `env.environment`'s private cost tables/`REKEY_NOW` resolution, since `step()` doesn't surface them directly). 7 tests (`test_harness.py`), incl. the S1 x four-baselines zero-floor-violations check and a `run_grid` combination-count check. Only S1 exercised this session (S2-S6 dispatch not wired in `environment.py` yet). |

### attack/

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `attack/steering_trace.py` | not started | Stub, `test_steering_trace.py` is 1 import-smoke test. |

### dashboard/

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `dashboard/app.py` | not started | Stub, `test_dashboard_app.py` is 1 import-smoke test. |

### api/

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `api/main.py` | not started | Stub, `test_api_main.py` is 1 import-smoke test. |

### data/

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `data/get_data.py` | not started | All four `_download_*` helpers `raise NotImplementedError`; `main()` exists as a dispatcher shell. |
| `data/README.md` | present (doc) | Download instructions written. |
| `data/sample/` | empty | Only a `README.md` placeholder — no committed sample CSVs yet for CI/others to run against. |
| `data/raw/rt_iot2022/RT_IOT2022.csv` | placed, not ingested | Real dataset file present locally (gitignored, not committed); no code reads it yet. |

### docs/

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/report.md` | skeleton only | Section headers (Abstract, Intro, Related Work, Methodology 3.1-3.3, ...) with `_TODO_` markers and owner tags; no written content yet. |

### configs/

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `configs/default.yaml` | partial | `pool`, `key_lifetime`, `reward`, `use_foresight`, `tenant_graph.n_nodes`, `dqn`, `baselines`, `steering_attack` keys all present. `migration_schedule: []` empty (S6 not yet authored). `scenario: S1` — S2-S6 read but not dispatched by `environment.py`. |
